# Movie List App

###### This app allows users to add and manage a list of movies with details such as title, image URL, and rating.

###### The user can open a modal to input movie details by clicking the "Add Movie" button.

###### All fields—movie title, image URL, and rating (between 1 and 5)—must be filled in. If any field is left blank or the rating is not a number between 1 and 5, an alert notifies the user of incorrect input, and the movie is not added.

###### Added movies appear as list items displaying the movie poster, title, and rating. Users can remove a movie by interacting with the corresponding delete modal.

###### All interactions are handled through DOM manipulation, and modals are used for a smooth user experience.
